# The Education of Women in Africa

This repository is a reference for research in women's education. Different datasets can be found [here](https://www.ilo.org/shinyapps/bulkexplorer17/) where we got both the "Statutory nominal gross monthly minimum wage -- Harmonized series - Annual" and "SDG indicator 8.5.2 - Unemployment rate (%) - Annual" datasets and [here](https://databank.worldbank.org/) where we got an "Average years of total schooling, age 75+, female" dataset. Running data through this code produces various statistical test results and graphs to go along with them. All datasets cover the years from 2000-2020.
